## How I Used AI

- Helped generate parts of the initial HTML, CSS, and JavaScript structure.
- Assisted in organizing the CSS layout and improving overall structure.
- Helped implement features such as the dark/light theme toggle and smooth scrolling.
- Suggested UI improvements like adding icons in the contact section.
- Helped identify and remove unused CSS and improve typography consistency.
- Assisted in debugging styling conflicts and resolving CSS specificity issues.
- Assisted in refining and organizing the project documentation.
- AI was mainly used during the layout structuring and feature implementation phase. I consulted it for specific technical guidance rather than generating the full project.

## Responsible Use

- I reviewed all AI-generated suggestions before implementation.

- I ensured full understanding of all implemented features.
- AI was used as a support tool for problem-solving rather than a replacement for my own work.
